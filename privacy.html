    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="prose-updated">Last updated: 13 February 2026</p>

    <h2>Data controller</h2>
    <p>Regen Studio is a design and innovation studio based in The Hague, The Netherlands, and São Paulo, Brazil. Regen Studio is the data controller responsible for your personal data as described in this policy.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the websites at <strong>regenstudio.world</strong>, <strong>regenstudio.space</strong>, and <strong>demos.regenstudio.space</strong>.</p>
    <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:info@regenstudio.world">info@regenstudio.world</a></p>

    <h2>What data we collect</h2>
    <p>When you submit a contact form or demo access request, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>Your email address</li>
      <li>Your organization (if provided)</li>
      <li>Your message (if provided)</li>
      <li>The page URL you submitted from</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics on this site.</p>

    <h2>Legal basis for processing</h2>
    <p>We process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> (GDPR Article 6(1)(f) / LGPD Article 7(IX)) — to respond to your inquiry, manage our business relationship, and improve our services. We have assessed that this processing does not override your rights and freedoms.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> (GDPR Article 6(1)(a) / LGPD Article 7(I)) — by voluntarily submitting a contact form, you consent to the processing of your data for the purposes described in this policy. You may withdraw consent at any time by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use your data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To respond to your inquiry or access request</li>
      <li>To send you a confirmation email</li>
      <li>To notify our team of your submission</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for marketing, profiling, or automated decision-making.</p>

    <h2>Sub-processors and data storage</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to process your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase Inc.</strong> — database hosting in the European Union (Frankfurt, Germany). Used to store contact form submissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Resend Inc.</strong> — email delivery service (United States). Used to send confirmation and notification emails.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both processors are contractually bound to protect your data in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

    <h2>International data transfers</h2>
    <p>Your form submissions are stored in the EU. However, when we send confirmation emails via Resend, your email address and name are processed in the United States. This transfer is necessary to perform the service you requested (sending you a confirmation email) and is covered by appropriate safeguards including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) where applicable.</p>

    <h2>Who has access</h2>
    <p>Only the Regen Studio team and the sub-processors listed above have access to your data. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any other third parties.</p>

    <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
    <p>We retain contact submissions for up to 12 months after the last interaction, after which they are deleted.</p>

    <h2>Your rights under the GDPR (EU)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the European Economic Area, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right to:</p>
